# Very basic and small online supermarket clone

Began learning JavaScript a short time ago, and have begun trying to build a relatively functional small online supermarket clone.

In this project I've been utilising vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome icons, while trying to keep my code well commented and seperated.
